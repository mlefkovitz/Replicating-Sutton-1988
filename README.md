### RandomWalk.py
Contains the randomWalk function.
When called, this function returns a single random walk.

### Figure3.py
Implements numpy, random, and matplotlib. Also implements the randomWalk function above.
Seeded with random.seed(1)
Initially creates 100 training sets of 10 randomWalk sequences.
Loops through each training set with a set of lambdas to compute RMSE for each lambda, repeating until convergence (Experiment 1).
Plots RMSE vs Lambda and outputs to file (Sutton Figure 3).

### Experiment2.py
Contains the ExperimentTwo function.
When called, this function returns the weight calculated by the TD equation for the given randomWalk sequence, lambda, and alpha.

### Figure4.py
Implements numpy, random, and matplotlib. Also implements the randomWalk and ExperimentTwo functions above.
Seeded with random.seed(1)
Initially creates 100 training sets of 10 randomWalk sequences.
Loops through each training set with a set of lambdas and alphas to compute RMSE for each lambda-alpha combination (Experiment 2).
Plots RMSE vs alpha for each lambda and outputs to file (Sutton Figure 4).

### Figure5.py
Implements numpy, random, and matplotlib. Also implements the randomWalk and ExperimentTwo functions above.
Seeded with random.seed(1)
Initially creates 100 training sets of 10 randomWalk sequences.
Loops through each training set with a set of lambdas and alphas to compute RMSE for each lambda-alpha combination (Experiment 2).
Identifies best RMSE for each lambda.
Plots RMSE vs lambda and outputs to file (Sutton Figure 5).
